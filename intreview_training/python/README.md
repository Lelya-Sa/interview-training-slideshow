# Python - Interview Material

## Definition
Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms including object-oriented, imperative, functional, and procedural programming.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Data Types
- **Primitive Types**: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `None`
- **Collections**: `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`
- **Mutable vs Immutable**: Understanding which types can be modified

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Special Methods (Magic Methods/Dunder Methods)
- Decorators and Descriptors

### 3. Python Internals
- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
- CPython vs PyPy
- Generators and Iterators
- Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- Garbage Collection
- Memory Management

### 4. Advanced Features
- Decorators
- Context Managers
- Generators and `yield`
- List Comprehensions
- Lambda Functions
- Async/Await

### 5. Frameworks and Libraries
- Django vs FastAPI
- Web Frameworks
- Request-Response Lifecycle

### 6. Best Practices
- PEP 8 Style Guide
- Virtual Environments
- Code Organization
- Testing
