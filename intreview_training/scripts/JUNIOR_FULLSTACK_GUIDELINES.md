# Junior Fullstack Interview - Data Structures Guidelines

## Focus Areas for Questions

### ✅ Appropriate Topics (Junior Level)
1. **Basic Data Structures**
   - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
   - Hash Tables/Maps, Sets
   - Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees
   - Heaps (Min/Max)
   - Graphs (basic concepts)

2. **Common Operations**
   - CRUD operations
   - Traversal methods
   - Search and sort
   - Basic algorithms using data structures

3. **Practical Questions**
   - When to use each data structure
   - Time/space complexity analysis
   - Real-world use cases
   - Implementation details
   - Edge cases and error handling

4. **Interview-Style Questions**
   - "Implement a stack using arrays"
   - "Reverse a linked list"
   - "Find duplicates in array"
   - "Two sum problem"
   - "Valid parentheses"
   - "Merge two sorted arrays"

### ❌ Avoid Advanced Topics (Senior Level)
- Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees
- Suffix Trees, Suffix Arrays
- B-Trees, B+ Trees
- Advanced self-balancing trees (AVL, Red-Black - basic concepts OK, full implementation too advanced)
- Bloom Filters, Skip Lists
- Sparse Tables, Cartesian Trees
- Treaps, Splay Trees
- Rope data structures

### 📝 Question Format
- Clear, practical questions
- Real-world scenarios
- Code examples in both JavaScript and Python
- Time/space complexity notes
- Common use cases
