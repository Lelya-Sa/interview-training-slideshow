# Why Are Manhole Covers Round?

## Problem
Why are manhole covers typically round instead of square or other shapes?

## Approach
Think about geometric properties: can the cover fall through the hole?

## Solution
**Key Reasons:**
1. **Cannot fall through:** A round cover cannot fall through its hole regardless of orientation. A square cover can be rotated diagonally and fall through.
2. **Easier to move:** Round covers can be rolled to move them.
3. **Equal strength:** Circular shape distributes stress evenly in all directions.
4. **No orientation needed:** Can be placed in any rotation.

**Answer:** Round covers cannot fall through their holes, unlike square/rectangular covers which can be rotated diagonally to fit through.

## Complexity
- **Time**: O(1) - This is a geometric/logical reasoning problem, not an algorithm
- **Space**: O(1) - No computation required
- **Note**: This tests understanding of geometric properties and engineering design principles

## Follow-up
- What other shapes have this property?
- Why not use hexagons?
- What are the engineering trade-offs?
