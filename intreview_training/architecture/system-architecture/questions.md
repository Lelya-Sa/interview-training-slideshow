# System Architecture - Interview Questions

## Questions (1-10)

### 1. What is system architecture?
**Answer:** High-level structure of system, components, relationships, principles guiding design. Blueprint for system.

### 2. What are the main types of system architectures?
**Answer:** Monolithic, Microservices, Serverless, Event-Driven, Layered, Service-Oriented (SOA).

### 3. What is monolithic architecture?
**Answer:** Single, self-contained application. All components in one codebase, deploy as single unit. Simple but hard to scale.

### 4. What is microservices architecture?
**Answer:** System composed of small, independent services. Each service has own database, communicates via APIs, deploy independently.

### 5. What are the benefits of microservices?
**Answer:** Independent deployment, technology diversity, scalability, fault isolation, team autonomy, focused services.

### 6. What are the challenges of microservices?
**Answer:** Complexity, network latency, data consistency, distributed transactions, service discovery, monitoring, testing.

### 7. What is event-driven architecture?
**Answer:** Services communicate through events. Publisher emits events, subscribers react. Decoupled, asynchronous communication.

### 8. When would you choose monolithic vs microservices?
**Answer:** Monolithic: small team, simple app, rapid development. Microservices: large team, complex domain, need scalability.

### 9. What is service-oriented architecture (SOA)?
**Answer:** Services communicate through well-defined interfaces. Reusable services, enterprise integration, more formal than microservices.

### 10. How do you design a scalable system architecture?
**Answer:** Horizontal scaling, load balancing, caching, database optimization, asynchronous processing, microservices, CDN, monitoring.
