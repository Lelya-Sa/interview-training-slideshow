# Design Patterns - Interview Questions

## Questions (1-15)

### 1. What are design patterns? Why use them?
**Answer:** Reusable solutions to common problems. Benefits: proven solutions, better code organization, easier maintenance.

### 2. Explain the Singleton pattern.
**Answer:** Ensures only one instance of class exists. Use for shared resources like database connections.

### 3. Explain the Factory pattern.
**Answer:** Creates objects without specifying exact class. Encapsulates object creation logic.

### 4. What is the Observer pattern?
**Answer:** One-to-many dependency. When subject changes, all observers are notified. Used in event systems.

### 5. Explain the Strategy pattern.
**Answer:** Defines family of algorithms, makes them interchangeable. Client chooses algorithm at runtime.

### 6. What is the Adapter pattern?
**Answer:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. Wraps object to match expected interface.

### 7. Explain the Decorator pattern.
**Answer:** Adds behavior to objects dynamically without modifying their structure. Wraps objects.

### 8. What is the Repository pattern?
**Answer:** Abstraction layer between business logic and data access. Encapsulates data access logic.

### 9. Explain Dependency Injection.
**Answer:** Objects receive dependencies from outside rather than creating them. Improves testability and flexibility.

### 10. What is the Middleware pattern?
**Answer:** Chain of handlers processing requests. Each handler can process and pass to next.

### 11. When would you use Singleton vs Factory?
**Answer:** Singleton for single shared instance. Factory for creating multiple instances of different types.

### 12. What is the difference between Strategy and State patterns?
**Answer:** Strategy changes algorithm, State changes behavior based on internal state.

### 13. Explain the Command pattern.
**Answer:** Encapsulates request as object. Enables queuing, logging, undo operations.

### 14. What is the Facade pattern?
**Answer:** Provides simplified interface to complex subsystem. Hides complexity from client.

### 15. How do design patterns improve code quality?
**Answer:** Provide proven solutions, improve maintainability, make code more understandable, facilitate communication.
