# Simple CI/CD Example - Perfect for Beginners
# This is a minimal GitHub Actions workflow to get started
# Location: .github/workflows/basic-ci.yml

name: Basic CI Pipeline

# Trigger on every push and pull request
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  # Single job that does everything
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      # Step 2: Setup Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      
      # Step 4: Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      
      # Step 5: Build the app
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

# That's it! This simple pipeline:
# 1. Gets your code
# 2. Sets up Node.js
# 3. Installs dependencies
# 4. Runs tests
# 5. Builds the application
#
# If any step fails, the pipeline stops and reports the error.
# This ensures only working code gets merged.
