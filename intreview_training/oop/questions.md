# OOP - Interview Questions

## Core Concepts

### 1. What are the four pillars of OOP?
**Answer:** Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.

### 2. What is encapsulation?
**Answer:** Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some components.

### 3. What is abstraction?
**Answer:** Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features. User works with high-level interface.

### 4. What is inheritance?
**Answer:** A mechanism where a new class derives properties and behavior from an existing class. Enables code reuse and hierarchy.

### 5. What is polymorphism?
**Answer:** Ability of objects of different types to respond to the same method call. Same interface, different behavior (overloading, overriding).

### 6. What is the difference between class and object?
**Answer:** Class is a blueprint/template; object is an instance of a class created at runtime.

### 7. What is a constructor?
**Answer:** Special method that runs when an object is created. Used to initialize state.

### 8. What is method overriding vs overloading?
**Answer:** Overriding: subclass redefines a method from parent. Overloading: same method name, different parameters (same or different types).

### 9. What is composition vs inheritance?
**Answer:** Composition: "has-a" – object contains other objects. Inheritance: "is-a" – subclass extends parent. Prefer composition when possible.

### 10. What are access modifiers (public, private, protected)?
**Answer:** public: accessible everywhere. private: only within class. protected: within class and subclasses.
