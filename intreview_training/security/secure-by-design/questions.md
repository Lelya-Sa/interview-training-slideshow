# Secure by Design - Interview Questions

## Questions (1-10)

### 1. What does "secure by design" mean?
**Answer:** Building security into system from the start, not as afterthought. Proactive security approach, part of design process.

### 2. What are secure by design principles?
**Answer:** Defense in depth, least privilege, fail securely, separation of duties, secure defaults, input validation, encryption.

### 3. What is defense in depth?
**Answer:** Multiple layers of security controls. If one fails, others provide protection. Network, application, data, access controls.

### 4. What is principle of least privilege?
**Answer:** Grant minimum permissions needed. Users, services, processes should have only necessary access, reduces attack surface.

### 5. What is fail securely?
**Answer:** System should fail in secure state. Default deny, handle errors securely, don't expose information in error messages.

### 6. How do you validate input in secure design?
**Answer:** Validate all input, whitelist allowed values, sanitize input, use parameterized queries, validate length and format.

### 7. What is secure coding?
**Answer:** Writing code with security in mind. Input validation, output encoding, error handling, authentication, authorization, encryption.

### 8. What are common security vulnerabilities to prevent?
**Answer:** SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication bypass, insecure deserialization, sensitive data exposure, insecure APIs.

### 9. How do you implement security in SDLC?
**Answer:** Security requirements, threat modeling, secure coding standards, security testing, code reviews, penetration testing, monitoring.

### 10. What is threat modeling?
**Answer:** Identifying security threats, assessing risks, defining countermeasures. STRIDE model, DFDs, risk assessment, mitigation strategies.
