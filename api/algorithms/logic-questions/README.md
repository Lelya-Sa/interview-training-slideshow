# Logic Questions - Interview Material

## Definition
Logic questions test your problem-solving ability, analytical thinking, system design reasoning, and debugging skills. These are different from algorithmic coding problems - they focus on reasoning, trade-offs, and real-world scenarios.

## Key Topics

### Brain Teasers & Puzzles
- Mathematical reasoning problems
- Classic interview puzzles
- Estimation questions
- Lateral thinking challenges

### System Design Logic
- Architecture decisions
- Scalability thinking
- Trade-off analysis
- Design patterns reasoning

### Debugging & Problem Solving
- Identifying root causes
- Performance optimization
- Error analysis
- Troubleshooting scenarios

### Real-World Scenarios
- Production issues
- Distributed systems challenges
- Database optimization
- Caching strategies

## How to Study

1. **Read the Problem**: Understand what's being asked
2. **Think First**: Try to solve it yourself
3. **Explain Your Reasoning**: Practice articulating your thought process
4. **Consider Alternatives**: Think about different approaches
5. **Discuss Trade-offs**: Understand pros and cons

## Question Structure

Each question file contains:
- **Problem**: Clear problem statement
- **Approach**: High-level strategy
