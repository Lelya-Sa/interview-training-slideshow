# How Would You Test a Pen?

## Problem
How would you test a pen? Walk through your testing approach.

## Approach
Think systematically: functional testing, edge cases, usability, reliability, different user scenarios.

## Solution
**Testing Approach:**

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Does it write? On different surfaces?
   - Does ink flow consistently?
   - Does cap fit properly?

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Write at different angles
   - Write on wet surfaces
   - Write after dropping
   - Write in extreme temperatures

3. **Usability**
   - Is it comfortable to hold?
   - Is grip non-slip?
   - Can left/right-handed people use it?

4. **Reliability**
   - How long does ink last?
   - Does it leak?
   - Does it dry out if cap left off?
   - Shelf life?

5. **Different Scenarios**
   - Different paper types
   - Different writing speeds
   - Different pressure applied

**Answer:** Systematic testing covering functionality, edge cases, usability, reliability, and various usage scenarios.

## Complexity
- **Time**: O(n) where n is number of test cases - systematic testing process
- **Space**: O(1) - Testing methodology, no data structures needed
- **Note**: This is a testing methodology question, not an algorithm. Tests complexity depends on number of scenarios covered.

## Follow-up
- How would you test a login form?
- How would you test an API?
- What's the difference between testing and QA?
