# 100 Doors Problem

## Problem
There are 100 closed doors in a hallway. You make 100 passes:
- Pass 1: Toggle every door (all open)
- Pass 2: Toggle every 2nd door (2, 4, 6, ...)
- Pass 3: Toggle every 3rd door (3, 6, 9, ...)
- ...
- Pass 100: Toggle door 100

Which doors are open after 100 passes?

## Approach
A door is toggled once for each of its divisors. A door is open if it has an odd number of divisors. Only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors.

## Solution
**Key Insight:** Perfect squares have odd number of divisors.

**Why:**
- Door n is toggled on passes that are divisors of n
- Door is open if toggled odd number of times
- Only perfect squares have odd number of divisors

**Example:**
- Door 12: Divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 (6 divisors, even) → Closed
- Door 16: Divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 (5 divisors, odd) → Open

**Perfect squares ≤ 100:**
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100

**Answer:** Doors 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 are open (all perfect squares).

## Complexity
- **Time**: O(1) - Direct mathematical solution: count perfect squares ≤ n = ⌊√n⌋
- **Space**: O(1) - No additional space needed
- **Note**: If simulating all passes: O(n²) time, O(n) space. But mathematical insight gives O(1) solution.

## Follow-up
- What if you make N passes?
- What if doors start open?
- How many doors are open after N passes?
