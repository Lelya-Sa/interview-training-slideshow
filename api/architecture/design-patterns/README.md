# Design Patterns - Interview Material

## Definition
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design.

## Creational Patterns

### Singleton
- Ensure only one instance exists
- Use case: Database connection, logger

### Factory
- Create objects without specifying exact class
- Use case: Creating different types of objects

### Builder
- Construct complex objects step by step
- Use case: Complex object construction

## Structural Patterns

### Adapter
- Allow incompatible interfaces to work together
- Use case: Integrating third-party libraries

### Decorator
- Add behavior to objects dynamically
- Use case: Adding features without modifying class

### Facade
- Provide simplified interface to complex subsystem
- Use case: Hiding complexity

## Behavioral Patterns

### Observer
- Notify multiple objects about state changes
- Use case: Event systems, MVC

### Strategy
- Define family of algorithms, make them interchangeable
- Use case: Different sorting algorithms

### Command
- Encapsulate request as object
- Use case: Undo/redo, queuing requests

## Common Patterns in Web Development

- **MVC**: Model-View-Controller
- **Repository**: Abstraction for data access
- **Dependency Injection**: Invert control of dependencies
- **Middleware**: Chain of responsibility
- **Factory**: Object creation
- **Singleton**: Single instance
